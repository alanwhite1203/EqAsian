Asian options allow the buyer to purchase or sell the underlying asset at the average price instead of the spot price. Asian options are commonly seen options over the OTC markets. Average price options are less expensive than regular options and are arguably more appropriate than regular options for meeting some of the needs of corporate treasurers. Average can be calculated in a number of ways (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). This presentation provides an overview of Asian equity option product and valuation.
